# Leroy Merlin Technology Culture

Hello and welcome! This is home for Leroy Merlin Digital Technologies technology culture. All materials see in the `content` folder.

## What is the purpose

The main reason for this site is to have all common technical agreements in a written form in the central place.

## Contributing

All content crafted manually by the group of enthusiasts.
You can find `.md` files in the `content` folder.
The contribution is welcomed, let's build, support, and describe the best engineering culture.

Feel free to open PR or Issue in this repo. 
There is no special described process of updating the values or other content.
Therefore, the form of change is open and free. 
Our goal is to describe and align the culture with all colleagues.

In case of any questions, contact with Dmitrii Sugrobov.

## Edit the content using GitHub UI

It is possible to change the content directly using GitHub UI edit function. 
After the merge to the `master` branch the content will be automatically updated on the site.

## Running the website locally

First, you should have [Hugo-Extended](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) installed.
!NOTE! I recommend you to install prerequisites from the previous link and Hugo Extended from this link https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.96.0

The following will give you a project that is set up and ready to use (don't forget to use `--recurse-submodules` or you won't pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site). The `hugo server` command builds and serves the site. If you just want to build the site, run `hugo` instead.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/adeo/lmru--tech
cd lmru--tech
hugo server
```
